SmileBankStatementToCSV
=======================

A simple script to scrape statement data from Smile Bank's online banking interface for manual exporting.

Get Bookmarklet on the project page: http://daaain.github.com/SmileBankStatementToCSV/

Just log in to Smile and once you're on a statement page (works for both current and older ones) click on the bookmarklet.

In a few seconds after getting the statement data and converting to CSV it shows a jQuery Fancybox with the text preselected, so you only have to press ctrl + c / cmd + c and paste the exported data into your favourite texteditor.

Based on: http://simianstudios.com/blog/post/smile-csv-scraper-for-freeagent-and-xero but not depending on Flash and not freaking out Google Chrome by loading content from insecure (non-https) sources. There's a bit more on how to use it there though, so if my explanation didn't enlight you just click through!
